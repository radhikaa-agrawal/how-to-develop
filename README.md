# how-to-develop
No bullsh*t, Just the practical way to code and develop softwares, applications, programs without wasting your time on _courses_, _teaching materials_ etc.
## Why?
Looking to jump into development journey? perhaps planning to learn react/flutter/webdev, or some cool sounding tech stack and get high paying jobs..? Don't worry, we got you covered (or maybe not).

## A word of caution
